##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 15 does not contain any code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
var x = 3.14 // Double type
var y = "Hello" // String type
var z = true // Boolean type
```

To follow along with the examples in this book, you'll need an Apple computer with OS X 10.11 or higher installed. You'll also need to install Xcode version 8.0 or higher with Swift version 3 or higher.
