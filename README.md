##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 15 does not contain any code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
var x = 3.14 // Double type
var y = "Hello" // String type
var z = true // Boolean type
```
